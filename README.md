This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and mutable arrays.  Directly modifying a mutable array using methods like `-addObject:` or `-removeObject:` from within the same object that's observing the array can lead to unreliable KVO notifications. This is because KVO primarily works via method calls for detecting changes. The provided `bug.m` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.m` offers a solution using `NSMutableArray`'s `-removeObjectAtIndex:` method and `-insertObject:atIndex:` methods.
