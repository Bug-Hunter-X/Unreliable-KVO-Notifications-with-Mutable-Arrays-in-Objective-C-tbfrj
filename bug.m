In Objective-C, a subtle bug can occur when using KVO (Key-Value Observing) with mutable arrays. If you modify the array directly using methods like -addObject: or -removeObject:, the KVO notifications might not be triggered reliably, especially if the changes are made from within the same object that is observing the array. This can lead to unexpected behavior in parts of your application relying on those KVO notifications.  The issue stems from the fact that KVO primarily relies on method calls to detect changes, and direct modifications bypass this mechanism.
